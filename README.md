Given code constructs the testing and training data by itself.
First set the value of n in the code after the comment "generate data" 
so according to the value of n the code will get the number of helberg code size for all the possible n, m, a, and s.
then the regression model will be trained using that data. Tested accordingingly.
copy the code and paste it in any python interpreter, set the value of n according to the computational power of the device.
Super computer will give accurate results.
